Avaliable maps
-------

[ðŸ—º A list of all avaliable maps with demo and editing urls â€¦](./demo_links)

Install
-------

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run local
---------

```
mapproxy-util serve-develop config.yml
```

Deployment
----------

```
# creates the wsgi.py script
mapproxy-util create -t wsgi-app -f config.yml wsgi.py
```

Note: We don't use `make_wsgi_app(â€¦, reloader=True)` but restart the server manually. The auto reloading would only restart if the config is valid, which would hide a broken edit. The manual reload will make the error visible.

Create a systemd service script in `/etc/systemd/system/mapproxy.service`.

```
[Unit]
Description=Mapproxy gunicorn daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
User=tiles
Group=tiles
WorkingDirectory=/srv/tiles/proxy
ExecStart=/srv/tiles/proxy/env/bin/gunicorn --access-logfile /var/log/mapproxy/access.log --error-logfile /var/log/mapproxy/error.log --bind unix:/tmp/mapproxy.sock --workers 9 wsgi:application

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start mapproxy
```

Add to nginx configuration:

```
    location /proxy/ {
        proxy_pass http://unix:/tmp/mapproxy.sock;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Script-Name /proxy;
    }
```

```bash
nginx -t
systemctl start nginx
```

Debugging
---------

### Which config sources are recognized by Mapproxy?

Use the [Mapproxy Debug Page](https://mapproxy.codefor.de/demo/). It lists all layers that are avaliable based on the config.
However, there is an issue with the projection, so the previews do not work.

### Which URLs does the Mapproxy call?

Check that [log.ini](log.ini) "active" (not commented out); if needed, change and restart.
Use `cat mapproxy-config/mapproxy_log/source-requests.log` to see the requested URLs.

Copy one of those URLs and fiddle with the URL params the browser until the right image is shown.

### Remeber to delete the file system cache.

`ls mapproxy-config/cache_data/` shows all layer that have cached images. Remove the folder to trigger a cache refresh, eg `rm -rf mapproxy-config/cache_data/alkis_30_cache_EPSG900913`

### Remeber to refresh the browser cache.

Even with a fresh file system cache, images might still be cached in the browser. Unfortunately, iD Editor does not allow hard reloads to refresh this data. One workaround is, to zoom and pan the map so new images are requested.

### Which layer are avaliable for a given WMS service?

Use URLs like `https://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb/wms/senstadt/wmsk_alkis?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities&version=1.3.0` to create a list of layer IDs with description. Examples are [layer_alkis_berlin.md] and [layer_strassenbefahrung_berlin.md].

You can also try https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rbuffat/eli-helper/master ([GitHub](https://github.com/rbuffat/eli-helper)) with the fbintern URL from above to get a list of avaliable layers.
