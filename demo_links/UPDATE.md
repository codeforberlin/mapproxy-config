# How to update demo links

Regenerates `demo_links/README.md` with all layers and URL check results.

## Quick update

```bash
bun run create-demo-links
```

Or run all checks (layer docs, URL validation, demo links):

```bash
bun run check-all
```

See [README.md](../README.md#helper-scripts) for all available scripts.
